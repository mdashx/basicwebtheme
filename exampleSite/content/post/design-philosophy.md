+++

The column is 500px wide on desktop — roughly the width of a mobile screen, and close to the optimal line length for reading (65–70 characters per line). On mobile it fills the viewport. Nothing competes for the reader's attention.

This is a deliberate constraint, not a limitation to work around.

### What the theme does not have

- No sidebar
- No card grid
- No hero image
- No navigation bar
- No JavaScript

### What it does have

- One column
- A header that links home
- A footer with your navigation
- Dark mode via `prefers-color-scheme`
- System fonts (no web font loading)
- Tables, code blocks, blockquotes

### The navigation model

There is no top nav bar. Navigation lives in the footer. The header is a logo or site name that always links back to `/`. Every page has the same chrome:

```
[header — links home]
[hr]
[your content]
[hr]
[footer — nav links + last-updated date]
```

If your content needs more wayfinding than a footer menu and inline links, the answer is better content organization — not more navigation chrome.

### Why system fonts

Loading a web font means an extra network request, a flash of invisible or unstyled text while it loads, and a file being fetched from a third-party CDN (often Google). System fonts are already on the device, render immediately, and respect whatever the user has configured.

The tradeoff is that the site looks slightly different on macOS, Windows, and Linux. That's fine.

### Why no JavaScript

Every feature on this site works without it. No trackers, no analytics scripts, no cookie consent banners, no hydration overhead. The HTML is the product.
